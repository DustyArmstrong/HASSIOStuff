## todo-notifications.yml

Raw YAML for an automation that will send notifications based on local to-do list due dates. Set to fire 3 times a day with the to-do entry name in the notification. Easily modified or improved to suit your needs. Currently fires notificaiton to the mobile companion app, but can be changed (ensure you replace the placeholders with your own entity).
